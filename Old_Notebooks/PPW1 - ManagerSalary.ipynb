The responses are collected in a Google Form and the questions are mostly short-form text response fields, with a few being multiple choice responses.

    "[Pandas `.merge()`](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/reference/api/pandas.merge.html) is a method that allows us to merge two dataframes on columns they have in common, in one of several distinct ways. This is essentially the same as a JOIN function with SQL, just written in a different syntax.\n",
