    "Python's builtin `datetime` module is a powerful tool for reformatting dates and times so they can be applied across different timestamp paradigms, whether to make them more human-readable, or more machine-readable. `datetime` is host to a number of useful classes, including the redundantly-named `datetime`, which is a combination of the `date` class and the `time` class, as well as `timedelta`, which expressed the difference between `date` and/or `datetime` objects, as well as classes specific to handling time zones, `timezone` and `tzinfo`. \n",
    "\n",
    "However, `datetime` leaves something to be desired in ease of use. The `dateutil` package is an extension to `datetime` that makes parsing and formatting dates easier. It adds additional capability for calculating time deltas by different units, more precise implementations of time zone, and most importantly for our purposes, robust support for parsing differently formatted dates."
