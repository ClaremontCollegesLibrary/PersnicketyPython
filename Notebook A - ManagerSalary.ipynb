    "Our first dataset comes from a Google Sheet that contains survey responses from employees in different management positions at different institutions, from 2021 to present. The survey was conducted as a [blog entry for Ask A Manager](https://www.askamanager.org/2021/04/how-much-money-do-you-make-4.html). The responses are collected in a Google Form and the questions are mostly short-form text response fields, with a few being multiple choice responses. This survey is real-world data, survey participants are all voluntary and self-selected. Most likely, the participants are followers of the Ask A Manager blog and/or the podcast.\n",
