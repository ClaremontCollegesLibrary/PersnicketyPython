To access the first element of a list, you have to put square brackets after the name of the list, and the number 0 inside them. Lists are \"mutable\", which means their order and contents can be changed after they are created.\n",

Dictionaries are also mutable. To access a value, you must put square brackets after the name of the dictionary, and put the name of the related key in the brackets.\n",
