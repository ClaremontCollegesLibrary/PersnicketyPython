# PersnicketyPython

Text data cleaning workshop for February 13, 2025 and April 1, 2025.

Modules 0 and 1 are essential; 2-5 are optional, as they cover more specific topics.

These materials are best used for an in-person workshop, but they are also intended to be used as a self-paced tutorial for the included topics.

If you have questions or suggestions, please don't hesitate to reach out! My email is david.merten-jones@claremont.edu
